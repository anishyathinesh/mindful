# mindful
Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present and aware in the moment without judgment.

I took a meditation wellness class that inspired me to practice a little bit of mindfulness each day. I like to clear my head but also focus my thoughts to goals and affirmations I want to recognize for the day. It's sometimes hard to focus my thoughts, so I created this app!
